I am a second year M.S./Ph.D. student in Computer Science at `UW-Madison`, where I am fortunate to be advised by **[prof. Yong Jae Lee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/)**.  Prior to joining UW-Madison, I spent a great time at **[Krafton AI](https://www.krafton.ai/en/)** as a research intern, working closely with **[prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/aboutme/)**, **[prof. Dimitris Papailiopoulos](https://papail.io/)** and **[prof. Ernest K. Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/)**. I hold a bachelor's degree from SNU with *summa cum laude* in Mathematics and Computer Science along with a minor in Philosophy of Science ([link](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Science_and_technology_studies)), and was fortunate to be advised by **[prof. Wonjong Rhee](https://drl.snu.ac.kr/people/professor)**.

My research interest lies in improving, understanding, and analyzing foundation models, both empirically and theoretically. I ultimately envision developing deployable machine learning agents that can solve challenging real-world problems. Currently, I am interested in multimodality, robustness and mathematical and compositional reasoning.


📣 _**I am actively looking for internship positions for 2026 Summer on multimodal models.**_
